Welcome to TwitterRedux! A tiny social network built on React.

Working on this project, I have learned React and Socket.io. I went beyond the simple state management requirements and implemented React Redux state on every module to make it a single-page application. It was challenging but fun!

App features:

-   Create personal profile
-   Upload profile picture (cloud storage on AWS)
-   Request/Accept/Reject friendships
-   Send real-time messages to the entire community
-   Add statuses/tweets to show on your profile

Back-end specifications:

-   Express & Axios
-   Socket.io
-   React Redux
-   AWS
-   PostgreSQL
-   Bcrypt
-   CookieSession
